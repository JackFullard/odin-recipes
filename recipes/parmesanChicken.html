    <p>This extra-crispy sheet pan chicken and veggies dinner is baked on one pan and packed with flavor!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 Â½ pounds skinless, boneless chicken breasts, pounded flat and excess fat removed</li>
        <li>1 cup freshly grated Parmesan cheese, divided</li>
        <li>1 cup panko bread crumbs</li>
        <li>4 tablespoons butter, melted</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <Li>Preheat the oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). Line a sheet pan with parchment paper. </Li>
        <Li>Combine oregano, parsley, paprika, garlic powder, seasoned salt, and pepper in a small bowl. </Li>
        <Li>Place green beans, potato, bell pepper, broccoli, and garlic onto the prepared sheet pan. Drizzle with olive oil and sprinkle with 1/2 of the seasoning mix; toss to coat. </Li>
        <Li>Place flour into a bowl. Place melted butter into a second bowl. Mix panko, 2/3 cup Parmesan cheese, and the remaining seasoning mix together in a third bowl. </Li>
        <Li>Slice chicken into 1 1/4-inch strips, then coat in flour. Dredge floured strips in melted butter, dripping excess butter back into the bowl. Press into Parmesan-panko mixture until heavily coated on both sides. </Li>
        <Li>Push veggies to one half of the sheet pan. Place coated chicken strips onto the other side. Sprinkle any remaining Parmesan-panko mixture over chicken, pressing to adhere. Let the lasagna rest before serving.</Li>
        <Li>Bake in the preheated oven for 10 minutes. Flip chicken strips and stir veggies, then continue to bake until chicken juices run clear and veggies are crisp-tender, 10 to 15 more minutes. An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of the chicken should read at least 165 degrees F (74 degrees C). </Li>
        <Li>Meanwhile, make the dipping sauce: Whisk mayonnaise, ketchup, garlic powder, and Worcestershire sauce together in a small bowl. </Li>
